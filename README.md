gashIP is an Open-Source Batchile script that geolocates any IP given in seconds without any external apps necessary!

# ARCHIVED!

This tool has been archived, that means I will no longer be updating this or adding anything new to the script. This will still be downloadable and still be on my profile, so its not going anywhere.

### Why?

Simply, I am not proud of this tool! I do not want to associate with this tool at all! In a less proper sense, "Fuck this tool".

## üìã Commands:

   -Use the command "HELP" for a instructions.

   -Use the command "LOG" to view the previously scanned IPs.

   -Use the command "EXIT" to leave gashIP.


## üìÑ How To Use!

1. Make a text file containing the IP you would like to geolocate

2. Type in the file name inside of gashIP (Specify what type of file it is!)

(WAIT FOR IT TO FINISH)

3. Check the newly created folder named "output" to see the results

(For the raw JSON Responses, goto the output folder "json_results". And for the geolocation info, go to the output folder "geolocation_results")

4. Just one more thing, DO NOT USE THIS TOOL WITH MALICIOUS INTENT!

You will not use the geolocation data for any purpose that is prohibited by law or regulation.
